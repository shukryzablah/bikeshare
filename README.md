# AC Bikeshare

## Inspiration

Amherst College handles their bike sharing in a google spreadsheets. We aim to provide a friendlier, cleaner, and more useful experience for students.

## What it does

This application handles the statuses of bikes, their check in, withdrawal, and check out. It keeps a log of the actions taken for later analysis.

## How we built it

Using Meteor.js to streamline the prototyping process, we connect our database and use react as a frontend for users to update the database entries.

## Challenges we ran into

Design is a challenge, we opted to go for an application that implements Material Design principles.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The application is easier to use than the existing google spreadsheet it will replace.

## What we learned

This is our first Hackathon. We learned the importance of planning, and prioritization. The most important lesson is to keep pushing and never give up.

## What's next for AC Bikeshare

AC Bikeshare will implement more functionality that provides a richer experience for managers and patrons alike. Some specific features that will come next include: -integration with Amherst College verification system -ability to contact patrons through application -security checks -real time sync and backups
